# Broad_Sales_Case_Study

This case study was completed as part of the BrightLight Data Analytics course, facilitated by Rofhiwa Nemukula. It focuses on analyzing a retail store’s daily sales data to uncover price performance trends, evaluate gross profit margins, and assess price elasticity of demand.

## Objective

Help the business understand how pricing impacts revenue and quantity sold by analyzing daily sales data, with a focus on:

- Gross profit % trends
- Unit pricing performance
- Promo periods and demand response
- Price elasticity insights

---

## Tools Used

- **Snowflake SQL** – Data cleaning, transformation, and metric calculations
- **Power BI** – Visual dashboards with time trends and KPIs
- **Canva** – Executive summary presentation for business stakeholders

---

## Key Metrics Calculated

- **Unit Price** = Sales ÷ Quantity
- **Gross Profit %** = (Sales – Cost) ÷ Sales × 100
- **Gross Profit per Unit** = (Sales – Cost) ÷ Quantity
- **PED (Price Elasticity of Demand)** = %ΔQuantity ÷ %ΔPrice

---

## Key Insights

- Promo periods with lower prices showed a significant spike in quantity sold
- Demand is price-sensitive (elastic), especially below R20 per unit
- Highest revenue comes from consistent pricing and mid-range prices
- Gross Profit % decreases sharply with excessive discounting

---

## Recommendations

- Use controlled pricing strategies to increase quantity sold without damaging margin
- Avoid pricing below minimum profitable levels
- Promote only during periods with high foot traffic
- Track price-performance impact weekly using a Power BI dashboard
